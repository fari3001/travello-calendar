### Travello Application 
I've built this app to envision the layout, structure, readbility, reusability and consistency across the multitude of components. In my previous role, I did not get to tango with API's as that was established predominently in the backend of the company. However, I made attempts at extrapolating the information from the API using Axios and React Query (also took a bit of a crash course in Apollo) without much luck. I do plan on establishing more knowledge around these areas and have enrolled in a course for that. Also, there was more time resources put into Bootstrap as that is a framework I have not utilised in a good couple of years. With that in mind, the approach to building out this technical test have been outlined **below**:

- Understand the task requirements and prerequisites.
- Breakdown the set of tasks into bite size chunks.
- Research the necessary key requirements.
- Consume the API so that the relavent information may be extrapolated (could not get the enpoint to connect).
- Modularise the structure of the page into its associated components.
- Make the page beautiful with some good css.
- Sprinkle functionality on the app.
 
 Just run **npm start** to run the app and you're good to go.
